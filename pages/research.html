    <h1>Websites We Used For Research Purposes</h1>
    <p>
        First and foremost, as an e-commerce platform specializing
        in healthy and authentic grocery products, our journey began
        with a visit to Mato.com.np, Nepal's leading brand in organic 
        living.

        While brainstorming the range of grocery products to feature, 
        we made a deliberate choice to prioritize Nepali-grown organic 
        goods. Our focus on locally sourced products not only benefits 
        you, our customers, but also supports our farmers and contributes 
        to the prosperity of our nation. As a result, our catalogue 
        exclusively showcases Nepali organic produce, with no imported 
        items.
